This was the sixth task of my internship, where I built a contact form using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I designed a simple form layout with fields for name, email, and message, and added form validation using JavaScript. I used regex to validate the email format and displayed error messages dynamically when inputs were empty or invalid. On successful validation, a success message was shown without actually submitting the form. This task helped me understand client-side validation, DOM manipulation, and the use of regular expressions in form handling.
